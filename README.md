# graphific
Graphific is a graph & network data structure library written in Rust.
The name is a combination of graph, and the Pacific ocean because there are a lot of
cargo routes (Cargo being the default packet manager for Rust).

Graphific is still under development. We do not recommend using it in production environment.

## Goals of the library
Here are the different focus point of the library by decreasing order of importance:
1. **Ready-to-use API** : well documented and easy to include in an already existing project.
1. **Data integrity** : include functional programming.
1. **Thorough tested** : A lot of unit tests.
1. **Performance** : Big O notation optimized and parallelism.

## Contributing
We welcome anyone and all kind of contribution !

Here are some rules :
* Before submitting a pull request, please open an [issue](https://github.com/Haxos/graphific/issues) and refer it on the pull request.
* Refer to the aim of the library. You can have the most performant code, if it's not documented, it
will not be accepted.
